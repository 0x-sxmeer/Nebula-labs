## Troubleshooting

### Swap Failed

- **Check Balance**: Ensure you have enough tokens for the swap AND enough native tokens (ETH, MATIC, BNB) for gas fees.
- **Slippage**: If the price is volatile, try increasing your slippage tolerance settings.
- **Liquidity**: Try a smaller amount or a different token pair.

### Wallet Not Connecting

- **Network**: Make sure your wallet is set to a supported network.
- **Cache**: Clear your browser cache or try a hard refresh (Ctrl+F5).
- **Updates**: Ensure your wallet extension (e.g., MetaMask, Rabby) is up to date.
